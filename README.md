# Kitsune Translations
These are the localization files for Kitsune for MyAnimeList. You can help translate the app to your native language by contributing to this open source project.

## How to use these files
- On macOS: You can clone this repo and open the desired .xcloc file on Xcode.
- On Windows: You can navigate to the language folder you want and open Localized Contents folder, inside it you'll find a .xliff file. You can use an online editor like http://xliff.brightec.co.uk to open this file and edit it.
- Using VS Code: You can navigate to the language folder you want and open Localized Contents folder.Inside, you'll find a .xliff file. Please select "Ignore" on the popup that says "Detected unusual line terminators.". Each string is a trans-unit and the translation lives inside the  <target state="translated">The translation goes here.</target> tag. You can check how it is done in the already translated tags and replicate it for the newer ones.
- If the language folder you want to add does not exist yet, you can copy an existing one and just changed it to your language code and work from this new folder.
