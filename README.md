# Kitsune Translations
These are the localization files for Kitsune for MyAnimeList. You can help translate the app to your native language by contributing to this open source project.

## How to use these files
- On macOS: You can clone this repo and open the desired .xcloc file on Xcode.
- On Windows: You can navigate to the language folder you want and open Localized Contents folder, inside it you'll find a .xliff file. You can use an online editor like http://xliff.brightec.co.uk to open this file and edit it. 
- If the language folder you want to add does not exist yet, you can copy an existing one and just changed it to your language code and work from this new folder. If you need help you can send me an email at <a href = "mailto: kitsune@alexandremadeira.dev"> contact@alexandremadeira.dev</a> or add me on Discord (alexm0475) and I'll help.

Everyone contributing will be listed on the About screen and can have a link associated with their name (to your own website or preferred social media). Thank you for helping!
