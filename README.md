# Kitsune Translations
These are the localization files for Kitsune for MyAnimeList. You can help translate the app to your native language by contributing to this open source project.

## How to use these files
- You can contribute using Apple Numbers, Google Sheets, or Microsoft Excel. For Apple Numbers, you can download the file [KitsuneLocalizations.numbers](https://github.com/MadeiraAlexandre/Kitsune-Translations/blob/main/Localizations/KitsuneLocalization.numbers), and for Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel, you can download [KitsuneLocalizations.xlsx](https://github.com/MadeiraAlexandre/Kitsune-Translations/blob/main/Localizations/KitsuneLocalization.xlsx). Create a new column for your language if there isnâ€™t one, and follow the "Should Translate" and "Comment" columns to guide you. Once you're done, you can either commit the file, send it via email to <a href = "mailto: kitsune@alexandremadeira.dev"> kitsune@alexandremadeira.dev</a> , or add me on Discord (alexm0475). If you need help, you can send me a message at any time.
- On macOS: You can clone this repo and open the desired .xcloc file on Xcode.
- On Windows: You can navigate to the language folder you want and open Localized Contents folder, inside it you'll find a .xliff file. You can use an online editor like http://xliff.brightec.co.uk to open this file and edit it.
- Using VS Code: You can navigate to the language folder you want and open Localized Contents folder.Inside, you'll find a .xliff file. Please select "Ignore" on the popup that says "Detected unusual line terminators.". Each string is a trans-unit and the translation lives inside the  <target state="translated">The translation goes here.</target> tag. You can check how it is done in the already translated tags and replicate it for the newer ones.
- If the language folder you want to add does not exist yet, you can copy an existing one and just changed it to your language code and work from this new folder. If you need help you can send me an email at <a href = "mailto: kitsune@alexandremadeira.dev"> kitsune@alexandremadeira.dev</a> or add me on Discord (alexm0475) and I'll help.

Everyone contributing will be listed on the About screen and can have a link associated with their name (to your own website or preferred social media). Thank you for helping!
You can send me your link that you want associated with your name and I'll add it in the next update. All the translations changes will also be added on the next update.
